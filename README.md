# Agentic AI Lab

This repository is a collection of experiments and notes on building agentic AI systems using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **LangSmith**. The focus is on understanding the fundamentals of autonomous agents, pipelines, and evaluation methods rather than creating production-ready software.

The work here is incremental and experimental. Each notebook explores a specific aspect of agent design, control flow, or evaluation. Over time, the repository will grow to include different approaches to RAG, multi-agent systems, and structured evaluation workflows.
